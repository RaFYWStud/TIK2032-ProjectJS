                Essentially there are 7 specific topic that u should learn about
                when u want to take an UTBK test. Those topics were general
                reasoning, reading comprehension and writing, general knowledge
                and understanding, quantitative knowledge, literacy in
                Indonesian, literacy in English, and mathematical reasoning.
                Personally, I have to prepare for this test in just like 5
                months because when I was in 12 grade I had a huge hope in SNBP
                (Merit-Based Admissions), but turns out I was not eligible to
                apply for this admission program. I was a little bit upset about
                this because the reason why im not eligible for SNBP is one of
                my teacher mistakenly switched my final math grade with my
                friend who has a low grade. But things must go on and I have to
                make the best out of the 5 month i have to prepare for the test.

                In the first month Im focusing on basic math like algebra,
                matrices, rules for numbers, etc. I did this because Im really
                weak in basic math as a 12 grader, so I have to make sure that i
                can do basic math before making it to the advanced one in
                quantitative knowledge. In the second month read a lot of novel
                in indonesian and english, I read like 4 novel in Indonesian and
                6 in English, I did this to make myself used to read a long
                paragraph without getting lost in the middle of it. It really
                improves my understanding of a topic and make me can read a lot
                faster but still get the meaning of the paragraph.

                The third to fourth month to this study session is the hardest
                one for me because I eventually have to deal with one of my
                biggest weakness and that is mathematical reasoning and
                quantitative knowledge. Although I have learnt about basic math
                in the first month, this is a whole different story when it
                comes to mathematical reasoning and intermediate to advance
                math. Mathematical reasoning need a real logic to solve the
                problem, so there is no fixed formula to solve it, you just have
                to strengthen your own logic with a bunch of logical question
                like "Ducks and Rabbits" question. For the quantitative
                knowledge, I watch a lot of youtube explanation about a question
                that might come out in the test and how to solve these question,
                I also read my notebook from 10-12 grades so I can remember some
                of the topics that I might have forgotten.

                I spent my last preparation month to do a tryout test in Zenius
                and when doing so Im starting to realize that 5 month is not
                enough time to prepare for this test. I did like 3 try out and i
                got like 300-400 score out of 1000. But it is too late to give
                up, I'd rather try and fail than never trying at all. So i did
                take the test at UPT-TIK Sam Ratulangi University and turns out
                I passed the test with around 600 average score out of 1000. I
                was really happy because Im really interested in taking IT
                Bachelor program in Sam Ratulangi University. My highest subtest
                score was 710 for literacy in English and as expected my lowest
                score was 440 for quantitative knowledge, but one unexpected
                thing was that I got 680 for mathematical reasoning (I guess I
                have some logic after all hehe). And that is my whole story
                taking an UTBK test, one last thing I wanted to say is that u
                should never give up a halfway through because u never know your
                true ability until you try it.
